##########  New malware detection framework based on N-grams and Support Vector Domain Description 
Description :
In this paper, we present a new framework for malware
detection. It’s based on N-grams method to extract features
from executable files

Représentation method :
Kolter and Maloof [1, 10] represented malware though Ngrams
as features and selected top 500 N-grams according to
information gain measure [10]. 

 Schultz et al [2]
extracted features with N-grams from a set of malicious
programs using three approaches (i.e the list of dynamic link
library calls, strings sequences and byte sequences),

 [8] collected features with N-grams and selected
them hierarchically, the result were classified using decision
trees, naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine.
